Description: This is a very simple Shiny application which 
  rolls Dungeons and Dragons dice a thousand times because my friends 
  and I often don't have a good intuitive sense of what, say, the 
  distribution of 4 ten sided dice will look like. I may add support 
  for adding together different dice, for example our Paladin rolls D10 
  and D4 for damage.
